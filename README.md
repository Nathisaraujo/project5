# OVERVIEW

Drawing Gratitude is an e-commerce platform designed to sell art. This idea came to life because I am an amateur artist. Drawing and painting are my favorite hobbies, and I decided to incorporate them into my final project.

This platform specializes in selling **heartfelt art gifts**. There's nothing better than a handmade gift full of meaning. The artwork available uses various materials, ranging from traditional paper art to digital drawings. 

The goal is for users to have an overview of all the available art pieces and purchase them directly from my website. Users can search for art by name or term using the search bar in the navbar, or they can browse by category and materials used.

### *Community*

:star: Users also have access to the **community page** to learn about the site's features. They can subscribe to the **newsletter** to receive emails about the latest news and updates. Community members can also send **drawing suggestions** to the artist.

### *Events*

:star: Additionally, there is an **events section** where users can view the events the artist has participated in and save the ones they are interested in to their profile.

### *Blog*

:star: Finally, users can access the **blog** to stay updated on various art-related topics and understand why consuming art is essential for life.

# DESIGN

The chosen design focuses on enhancing the user experience by fostering a close connection between the user and the artist selling the art. Unlike typical e-commerce sites cluttered with information and constant "buy now" prompts, the goal was to create a clean, friendly, and welcoming website. I wanted users to genuinely understand the reasons behind my work and feel inspired to purchase it, appreciating the meaningful story behind each piece.

## Typography

Each font was carefully selected to cultivate a relaxed, warm, and engaging atmosphere on the website, enhancing the overall user experience.

1. **Quicksand SemiBold 600** - it was chosen to give the website a softer and more inviting feel. Unlike harsh, squared fonts, Quicksand's smooth, rounded edges and balanced letterforms create a sense of comfort and coziness. This choice of font aligns with the overall design goal of making users feel welcome and at ease as they explore the art pieces.

2. **Le Jour Serif** - it was exclusively chosen for the logo image to add a touch of sophistication. Its elegant design provides a subtle yet distinct contrast to the overall relaxed and warm atmosphere of the website, creating a memorable and refined brand identity.

## Color Scheme

See below what is said about the color *purple* in [Color Theory](https://www.nixsensor.com/blog/color-column-violet/#:~:text=The%20color%20purple%20is%20often,mystery%2C%20independence%2C%20and%20magic.):

> Purple combines the calm stability of blue and the fierce energy of red. The color purple is often associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, power, and ambition. Purple also represents meanings of wealth, extravagance, creativity, wisdom, dignity, grandeur, devotion, peace, pride, mystery, independence, and magic.

The vibrant hue of purple was deliberately incorporated into the website's color scheme for two primary reasons:

1. Firstly, it is my favorite color, it serves as a personal touch, infusing the platform with a sense of passion and individuality. 

2. Secondly, taking into consideration the color theory, using purple on the website not only captures attention but also conveys a sense of exclusivity, inviting users to explore and indulge in the artistic experience it offers.

Inspired by the richness of the color purple, I created the following color scheme:

In addition, for alerts, edit, and remove buttons, I incorporated shades of red, green, and yellow that harmonize with the overall color scheme, leveraging the color tool to ensure consistency and visual coherence throughout the design.
